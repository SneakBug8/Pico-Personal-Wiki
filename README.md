# Pico Wiki

It's a modification of [PicoCMS](https://picocms.org/) 2.0 with intended purpose of using it as a wiki Engine.

What's added:
- Reworked Clutter theme
- Reworked edit plugin with passwords & recovery
- Option to integrate wiki into Wordpress themes. For that include wordpress.php into your Wordpress theme and modify .htaccess to redirect all requests to Wordpress installation.
